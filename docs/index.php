      <h2>What is SOCRATES?</h2>
      <p>SOcial and CRowdsourced AcTivities Extraction System (SOCRATES) is a general web toolkit for Social Media data, focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Collection</b> Writing scripts to fetch data from API's is a pain. Not to mention that API's all have different usage limits and data formats. SOCRATES aims to do all of the API calls and data collecting for you, returning everything into one easy to manage format which can be returned as JSON or CSV.</li>
        <li><b>Analysis</b> Data can be easily analyzed with textual analysis, statistics, and more.</li>
        <li><b>Exploration</b> SOCRATES allows you to view your data with different graphs and explore underlying patterns.</li>
      </ul>
  		<h2>Tutorial</h2>
  		<p>To get a glimpse into what SOCRATES is capable of, let's go through a scenario and see how we can use SOCRATES.</p>
