###How the infrastructure works
####Back-End
#####Basics
The back-end is written in Python and data is managed with MongoDB. The main tasks of the back-end are to collect data from social media sources (storing the resulting data in MongoDB) and perform analyses on that data. Because most API's return JSON and MongoDB works well with JSON all data sets are in JSON.
