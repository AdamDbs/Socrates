Issue Dongho found:
1) collect: reddit -> post -> sub as “entertainment”
2) analysis: text -> sentiment -> field “title” (since majority of the posts do not have any content)
3) exploration: graph -> scatterplot -> x with “upvotes” and y with “subjectivity”

Then, I got this error message in the top of menu frame in the left.
Error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'b.innerHTML.replace’)
