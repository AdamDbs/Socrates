				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Social media platforms and services such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, FourSquare, Flickr, WordPress, and Tumblr make more data available regarding people’s lives, intentions, thoughts, activities, and attitudes than ever before. As these services are shifting the social and communication infrastructure of our society, having proper tools and techniques to study these platforms becomes ever more critical for understanding social activities <cite>(Kooti, Yang, Cha, Gummadi, & Mason, 2012; Shah, 2010; Naaman, Boase & Lai 2010)</cite>, public opinion <cite>(Bennett & Iyengar, 2008; Castells, 2009)</cite>, political action <cite>(Parsons, 2010; Siegel, 2008)</cite> and more. At the same time, while new social media have been seized upon by researchers in marketing, advertising, and information science researchers <cite>(Blythe and Cairns, 2009; Xenos, 2010)</cite>, many fields still lack the tools and expertise to use these new social media in their research. Meanwhile, transformative social and political norms are emerging in online social practices and their off-line corollaries <cite>(Glynn, Huge & Lunney, 2009; Wallsten, 2010)</cite>. The pace of change and innovation is a significant challenge for researchers armed only with traditional tools and techniques (e.g., spreadsheets). These researchers currently lack the tools to collect and analyze social media at scale.</p>
				<p>Technical approaches alone are not sufficient for effective study of user behavior. At the root of this project is the use of crowdsourcing to study social media. The term crowdsourcing refers to the techniques that distribute labor across a wide, heterogeneous group of volunteers or paid participants. To create new tools for researchers of social media, the project will use advanced technical products developed through human-centered processes that incorporate crowdsourcing elements. Thus, the project will take advantage of the intelligence of both computers and people to study online social activities. Such human-computer partnership is the only way to study social media effectively, validly, and at scale.</p>
				<p>Thanks to the Internet, crowdsourcing has emerged as a potentially revolutionary method of getting work done. Crowdsourcing has been applied to product design, translation <cite>(von Ahn, 2011)</cite>, document processing <cite>(Soylent; Bernstein, et al, 2010)</cite>, travel planning <cite>(Bernstein, et al, 2012)</cite>, and scientific research <cite>(Mason & Suri, 2012)</cite>. In this project, we will use crowdsourcing to help researchers annotate, validate, and provide insights on individual pieces of data and aggregated summaries. The result of this project will be SOCRATES, a social-computational system and platform for the study of social media using crowdsourced activities. The project will develop a framework (Figure 1) and a technical system through which researchers can collect content from one or more social media sources, explore the collected content to help generate hypotheses, and analyze the content to produce insights, findings, and research results in true social-computational scale.</p>

				<p>To collect social media data at scale, SOCRATES will offer seamless support for researchers to obtain vast amounts of data from a variety of social media sources, as well as participatory sites and services. Importantly, the Collect component will include a crowdsourcing mechanism to help filter these huge streams of data according to the researcher’s characterization. For example, replacing the current practice of political scientists who copy and paste one Web page at a time, SOCRATES will allow researchers to automatically crawl millions of data items and filter them using both computer and human resources.</p>
				<p>To explore social media data at scale, SOCRATES will offer a way for researchers to gain insight about the collected dataset, and to explore the aggregate trends and individual content items. SOCRATES Explore will provide a set of visualizations of the collected data that enable targeted exploration. Importantly, targeted crowdsourcing, for example, following <cite>Heer, Viégas, & Wattenberg (2007)</cite>, will be applied to the exploration of the data, and increase the abilities of researchers to generate insights and theories based on it.</p>
				<p>To analyze social media data at scale, SOCRATES will support efficient, accurate, and valid annotation of the collected content using a specialized crowdsourcing environment. The purpose of such annotation is multifaceted, including but not limited to categorization leading to evidentiary inferences or hypothesis testing by social scientists and algorithm development by information scientists <cite>(Lu and Shulman, 2008; Yang, Callan & Shulman, 2006, Kwon, Hovy & Shulman, 2007)</cite>.</p>
				<p>Specific requirements for the prototype development and its implementation will be developed and informed by a series of interviews, focus groups, and a workshop with social scientists, communication and media scholars, and other researchers who are potential users of the platform. The goal is to develop a system that will apply to the work of researchers in many domains, as the possible uses of SOCRATES are many <cite>(Karpf, 2010)</cite>.</p>
				<p>To summarize, the main activities in this project will include developing and designing the requirements for the SOCRATES framework, and building a community of researchers that are currently using or could benefit from using such tools. The community built around the SOCRATES framework will not simply address existing problems in data-intensive research, but also help find new challenges and opportunities in socio-behavioral sciences.</p>
