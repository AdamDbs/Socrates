				<h3>Collect</h3>
				<p>SOCRATES will help researchers collect data from various social media as well as participatory sites and services. In the initial interviews and prototype deployments, a common workflow for researchers and scientists emerged: being able to collect social media data easily and effectively was found to be a highly crucial step. The SOCRATES Collect component will provide seamless support for collecting vast amounts of data from social media sites easily and effectively. This interactive component will let the researchers specify their needs quickly and intuitively (e.g., using keywords with source-selection), get them data from these disparate data sources, transform the data into standardized structured formats, and allow easy modification to initial setup and criteria for data collection. One of the important lessons learned from previous experiences, as well as preliminary investigations, is that such a component should be easily integrated into existing systems and practices. The project will therefore address the challenge of collecting large amounts of social media data with minimal effort on the researchersâ€™ end, in terms of learning new environments or assuring proper workflow with their existing systems.</p>
				<p>The development of the Collect component will be threefold: provide easy access points to social media data, create processes that fit into existing practices and systems, and help researchers to filter and validate the vast amount of data collected while assuring scalability and extensibility.</p>
				<p>SOCRATES will create an easy entry point for data collection to researchers with little or no technical background, while integrating the system into current research practices. Such a tool will not only support, but also encourage social scientists to start exploring various social media sites for their data and asking interesting and important questions. The investigators will build on the interview and focus group feedback, and experience with ContextMiner, to improve and streamline the data collection task.</p>
				<p>As a major activity, the project will create an environment in which researchers will be able to filter and tune the data collection via crowdsourcing. Many data collection tasks may involve criteria that cannot be easily captured by a computer. For instance, researchers might be interested in collecting Twitter messages favoring the Democratic Party or YouTube videos that visually depict urban environments. The project will investigate a human-in-the-loop crawling and collection mechanism in which researchers can couple an initial (computer-supported) crawling task with an advanced, human-supported filtering and validation phase (Bernstein et al., 2010).</p>
				<p>Finally, SOCRATES will help researchers iterate on data collection specifications to support evolving research questions and hypotheses. Based on the preliminary findings, this is a highly desired feature since often the researchers do not have a clear idea of what kind of data they could get from a social media site. SOCRATES components will provide a flexible and easily scalable data collection component so that researchers can create lightweight processes to quickly collect data for preliminary investigation, and then easily reformulate their initial request to get data further tuned to address their research questions.</p>
				<p>The primary challenge of the SOCRATES Collect component is how to let researchers, who may not possess proper technical skills, to interface with various social media services, access their content effortlessly in iterative manner, allowing them to ask and study questions that they would not have been able to otherwise.</p>
