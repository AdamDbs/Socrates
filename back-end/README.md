#Next Steps
- migrate the modules from context miner [After looking at the scripts, since they heavily depend on MySQL, and I would have to code the bridge between python and PHP, I think it would be easier to recreate the scripts (Youtube, Flickr, Twitter)
- add error logging
- add ability to have objects and nested structures in data (objects within objects, arrays within objects, etc.)
- polish each existing module to include more data/parameters, and the ability to specify the time of the data creation
- add API limits to meta of module specifications, this should facilitate campaign creation later
- Add mod_wsgi and integrate flask with apache
- Add median to stats
- Add operation module (sums, multiplication, etc.)
- Allow any number of a certain parameter to be specified (will be represented as an array in Python)
- Improved Youtube module to choose from specific time interval
- Update Youtube with new v3 API (v2 is deprecated)
